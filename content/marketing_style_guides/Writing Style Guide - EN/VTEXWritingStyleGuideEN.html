  <h1>VTEX Writing Style Guide&nbsp;-&nbsp;English<br>Volume 1 – Marketing & External Communication</h1>

  <p class="text-right"><span class="italic-text">Created by:</span>&nbsp;<a class="text-link" href="mailto:thalita.uba@vtex.com.br">Thalita Sdroiewski Uba</a></p>
  <p class="text-right italic-text">Last updated:&nbsp;12 de jul.</p>
  
  <h3>Welcome, marketing and communication professionals!</h3>
  <p>This Writing Style Guide was created specially for you. This is the first volume of a series of Style Guides that will <span class="bold-text">ensure consistency across the content we produce</span>&nbsp;at VTEX.</p>
  <p class="bold-text">WHY</p>
  <p>Our goal here is to <span class="bold-text">improve readability and build consistency</span> to&nbsp;deliver the best content possible&nbsp;to our target audience. That's where the Style Guide comes in: a practical and easy-to-read guide through our writing world. Here, you will find standards regarding <span class="bold-text">tone of voice, punctuation, capitalization, numbers, dates</span>, and <span class="bold-text">terminology,</span>&nbsp;and also some <span class="bold-text">good practices</span>&nbsp;that should be followed by anyone who writes any sort of text on behalf of the company.</p>
  <p class="bold-text">HOW</p>
  <p>Use it as <span class="bold-text">consulting material</span>&nbsp;whenever&nbsp;you're about to start a new text that falls within the following categories: <span class="bold-text">blog articles, customer pages, ebooks, guides, press releases, social media posts, solution briefs, scripts, whitepapers</span>, and other formats targeted toward external audiences. And don't forget to check it&nbsp;after you're done, when reviewing the text.</p>
  <p class="bold-text">WHAT</p>
  <p>This guide was written for all <span class="bold-text">marketing and institutional communication professionals</span>&nbsp;that write content for <span class="bold-text">external audiences</span>—earned, paid, or owned media. It does not contemplate internal communication and Product content (yet!).</p>
  <p>For further information, please visit the #content Slack channel or contact Thalita Uba via Slack (@thalita.uba) or at <a class="italic-text" href="mailto:thalita.uba@vtex.com.br">thalita.uba@vtex.com.br</a>.</p>

  <h2>Tone of Voice</h2>
  <p>VTEX's voice represents our <span class="bold-text">core brand elements</span>&nbsp;in the way we communicate. It ensures that our writing embodies <span class="bold-text">VTEX's personality and quality standards</span>&nbsp;across all touchpoints.</p>
  <p>It's really important that our tone of voice is <span class="bold-text">standard throughout the whole company</span>. That's why we need to be perfectly aligned with our brand guidelines.</p>

  <h4>Tone = Context</h4>
  <p>Before writing a text, ask yourself: <span class="bold-text">what's the purpose of this piece</span>? Is it supposed to catch people's attention? Do I want to explain a concept or communicate with our clients directly? Am I trying to catch someone's attention or communicating a failure within our platform? Our tone should adapt based on the user's and the message's context. Use the answers as a guide to find the right tone.</p>
  
  <h4>Voice = Personality</h4>
  <p>The Brand team grounded VTEX's personality in three pillars: <span class="bold-text">boldness, trustworthiness, and <span class="bold-text">optimism.</span></p>
  <h5>We are bold</h5>
  <p>We are technology and commerce specialists building our authority in the market. Our boldness lies in our capacity to be provocative, avoid fluffy words, and go straight to the point.</p>
  <h5>We are trustworthy</h5>
  <p>We're serious and soothe our clients' anxieties. Our words must convey precision, and not trigger doubts. We're reliable, we mean what we say. Our clients know they can count on us.</p>
  <p>We are optimistic</p>
  <p>We have many opportunities to explore, and the future is bright. We chase new opportunities, and we don't run away from challenges. Instead, we try to find a solution without pointing fingers at our competitors or audience.</p>
  <p>Let's take a look at some examples:</p>
  <p>✅ <span class="italic-text">Take the next step in your commerce journey. Deploy, test, and scale with more agility and less risk with the VTEX Enterprise Digital Commerce Platform.</span></p>
  <p>✅ <span class="italic-text">Give customers the choice and convenience they want while running an efficient omnichannel operation.</span></p>
  <p>✅ <span class="italic-text">With over 20 years of digital commerce knowledge, our team of specialists is here to guide you through your journey.</span></p>
  <p>This is what we get when we put it all together:</p>
  <p class="bold-text">VTEX is not the hero</p>
  <p><span class="bold-text">The audience is the hero, and VTEX is their guide</span>. We have so much to deliver to the world, and we tend to place ourselves as protagonists. Let's change this approach: when we present ourselves as a guide, we become the help they need to overcome their challenges. Let's see some examples:</p>
  <p class="bold-text">Talking to anybody</p>
  <p>🚫 <span class="italic-text">VTEX's distributed OMS is the solution that empowers ecommerce managers to view their complete commerce operation.</span></p>
  <p class="bold-text">Relatable</p>
  <p>✅ <span class="italic-text">Take control of your entire commerce operation with VTEX's distributed OMS.</span></p>
  <p class="bold-text">Audience-first</p>
  <p><span class="bold-text">It is never about us</span>. We believe that our communication strategy is the most powerful resource to start a conversation, so it's crucial to understand <span class="bold-text">who we are talking to.</span> Are they from a technology or business background? Are they from an operational role or a leadership position? What are their desires and pains? Try to address what our audience is looking for specifically. Avoid generic messages that try to talk to everybody and end up talking to no one. Let's see some examples:</p>
  <p class="bold-text">Generic</p>
  <p>🚫&nbsp;<span class="italic-text">VTEX launches a new SKU bulk loader that makes it easier to upload hundreds of SKUs to your store.</span></p>
  <p class="bold-text">Empowering</p>
  <p>✅ <span class="italic-text">Uploading hundreds of thousands of SKUs used to take several hours of your day. With the SKU bulk loader, you can have all those hours back.</span></p>
  <p class="bold-text">Simple and direct</p>
  <p><span class="bold-text">Be straightforward</span>. As a complex solution, we already use many concepts and specific jargon, so we must make our texts as clear and direct as possible. Anyone reading our announcements should be able to relate to what we are saying. Also, <span class="bold-text">avoid repetitions and ambiguities</span>. Always re-read your text to make sure there aren't too many repeated or unclear terms/ideas.</p>
  <p class="bold-text">A bunch of noise</p>
  <p>🚫&nbsp;<span class="italic-text">You can export complete reports with your store's main KPIs and assess if it's the best way to accomplish your organization's objectives.</span></p>
  <p class="bold-text">On point</p>
  <p>✅ <span class="italic-text">Use complete performance reports to keep track of the efficiency of your operation.</span></p>
  <p class="bold-text">Long story short:</p>
  <p>✅ Always know who you are talking to.</p>
  <p>✅ Our audience is the protagonist of every message. VTEX is the guide.</p>
  <p>✅ Keep it simple and straight to the point.</p>
  <p>✅ Find the balance between boldness, trustworthiness, and optimism to achieve the right tone.</p>
  
  <h2>Good practices</h2>
  <p>Readability tells us how clear and accessible our texts are. Content that is easier to understand will be easier to navigate. Thus, a readable text not only pleases Google when it ranks our pieces, but it also pleases the reader.</p>
  <p>Here are some rules of thumb for good readability scores:</p>
  <p>✅ Keep your sentences and paragraphs short and concise.</p>
  <p>✅ Keep similar and complementary ideas within the same paragraph.</p>
  <p>✅ Start a new paragraph when you want to present a new idea or point.</p>
  <p>✅ Avoid creating one-sentence paragraphs.</p>
  <p>✅ Use active voice as much as possible.</p>
  <p>✅ Replace long words with short synonyms, if possible.</p>
  <p>✅ Jargon and fancy words should be kept to a minimum.</p>
  <p>✅ Adapt to your audience.</p>

  <p>Eventually, some of our content will be adapted to British English, but unless you're writing specifically for this audience, please make sure you're following the American English rules.</p>
  
  <h4>Gender-neutral language</h4>
  <p>You can use the singular "they"&nbsp;as a generic third-person singular pronoun to refer to a person whose gender is unknown or irrelevant to the context.</p>
  <p>❗REMEMBER❗</p>
  <p>When “they” is the subject of a sentence, it takes a plural verb regardless of whether “they” is meant to be singular or plural. Therefore, <span class="bold-text">always write "they are"</span>&nbsp;(and not "they is").</p>
  
  <h3>Stative verbs</h3>
  <p>Stative verbs describe a state rather than an action. <span class="bold-text">We don't use them in the continuous form</span>.</p>
  <p>Here's a list of stative verbs.</p>

  <h5>Lists</h5>
  <p>When there is a list of items, use <span class="bold-text">periods</span>&nbsp;at the end of each item, rather than commas or semicolons. Capitalize<span class="bold-text">&nbsp;just the first word</span><span class="c1">, unless they're all titles (books, articles, songs, etc.)</span></p>
  <p class="italic-text">Example:</p>

  <h5>Dashes and hyphen</h5>
  <p>A <span class="bold-text">hyphen</span>&nbsp;(-) is a punctuation mark that is used to <span class="bold-text">join words or parts of words</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;only.</span></p>
  <p class="c38 c17 c15 c35"><span class="c2">An</span> <span class="bold-text c2">en dash</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;(–) is a punctuation mark that is used to indicate intervals of time or ranges of numbers</span></p>
  <p class="c38 c17 c15 c35"><span class="c2">An</span> <span class="bold-text c2">em dash</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(—) is a punctuation mark that can be used to replace parentheses or a colon to create emphasis in your writing.</span> <span class="bold-text c2">Do not add spaces</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;before or after the em dash.</span></p>

  <p class="bold-text">Footnotes and endnotes</p>
  <p>Footnote or endnote numbers in the text should <span class="bold-text">follow punctuation</span>&nbsp;and preferably be placed at the end of a sentence.</p>
  <p class="italic-text">Examples:</p>
  <p>🚫 <span class="italic-text">For that same retailer, the average order value (AOV) the retailer sees is about USD 70<span class="superscript-text">1</span></span>.</p>

  <h4>Numbers</h4>
  
  <h5>Numerals vs. words</h5>
  <p>If a number is <span class="bold-text">under 10 (including 10), spell it out</span>&nbsp;(e.g. one, two, three, etc.) If it is over 10, write it using digits (e.g. 43,775).</p>
  <p><span class="bold-text">❗Exception:</span>&nbsp;You can refrain from spelling out numbers under 10 if they are present in the <span class="bold-text">title</span> <span class="c1">because having numbers in titles has been shown to increase the click-through rate.</span></p>
  <p class="c7 c21"></p>
  <p>Avoid writing numbers at the beginning of the sentence, but if it’s a must, spell it out.</span></p>
  <p class="c7"></p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="italic-text">Example:</span></p>
  <p class="c12 c21">🚫 <span class="italic-text">50% of shoppers have opted for pick-up in-store</span><span class="italic-text">.</span></p>
  <p class="c12 c76">✅ <span class="italic-text">Half / Fifty percent of the shoppers have opted for pick-up in-store.</span></p>
  <p class="c12">When writing a figure from 1 to 9 (in dates or amounts, for example), <span class="bold-text">don't add a 0 in front of it</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
  <p class="c7"></p>
  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>🚫&nbsp;<span class="italic-text">The product was released on October 08 for a special price, only USD 9.90.</span></p>
  <p>✅&nbsp;<span class="italic-text">The product was released on October 8 for a special price, only USD 9.90.</p>
  
  <h5>Separators</h5>
  <p class="c12"><span class="bold-text">Thousands, millions, billions, etc., should be indicated with commas</span>&nbsp;(4,000; 10,500, and so on), and <span class="bold-text">decimals should be indicated with periods</span>&nbsp;(0.20; 0.67, and so on).</p>
  <p class="c7"></p>
  <p>You can use large number abbreviations for informal pieces the following way:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="c1">60 thousand = 60K</span></li>
    <li><span class="c1">60 million = 60M</span></li>
    <li><span class="c1">60 billion = 60B</span></li>

  <h3>Dates</h3>
  <p>We use the <span class="bold-text">month-day-year</span> format.</p>
  <p>Use <span class="bold-text">cardinal numbers</span>&nbsp;(one, two, three) rather than ordinal numbers (first, second, third).</p>
  <p class="italic-text">Example: Daniel was born on May 13.</p>
  <p>Place&nbsp;commas after the day of the week, the day, and the year.</p>
  <p class="italic-text">Example: My last day of work was Monday, May 5, 2020.</p>
  
  <h3>Time format</h3>
  <p>Use lowercase <span class="bold-text">a.m.</span>&nbsp;and <span class="bold-text">p.m.</span>, with periods. Do not forget to <span class="bold-text">add a space between the time and the a.m. or p.m.</span>&nbsp;If it's an exact hour, no “:00” is required.</p>
  <p>Examples: 6 p.m. | 6:30 a.m. | 8 p.m.</p>
  <p>When a time is given in Brazil time, include the GMT format.</p>
  <p>Example: 10:30 a.m. São Paulo (GMT-3).</p>
  
  <h3>Symbols</h3>
  <p class="c38 c17 c15 c35"><span class="c19">Use</span> <span class="c19 bold-text">space</span><span class="c3 c19">&nbsp;between the number and the unit of measure.</span></p>
  <p class="c38 c17 c15 c35"><span class="c32 c19">Example: 5 MB</span></p>
  <p class="c38 c11 c15 c35"></p>
  <p class="c38 c17 c15 c35"><span class="c3 c19">When the unit is a symbol and not an abbreviation (letters), no space is used.</span></p>
  <p class="c38 c17 c15 c35"><span class="c32 c19">Example: 36%, 5’</span></p>

  <h3>Compound and hyphenated words</h3>
  <p>As the English language evolves, lots of word associations are becoming compound words. There are three ways to write these: open compound (spelled as two words, e.g. ice cream), closed compound (joined to form a single word, e.g. notebook), and hyphenated compound (words joined by a hyphen, e.g. long-term).</span></p>
  <p class="c7"></p>
  <p>Here are some of the compounds we use regularly that should be written consistently throughout our content:</span></p>

  <p>Use a hyphen <span class="bold-text">if two or more words are functioning as an adjective</span>&nbsp;before a noun: <span class="italic-text">fastest-growing</span>&nbsp;platform; <span class="italic-text">world-class</span>&nbsp;retailer; <span class="italic-text">user-friendly</span>&nbsp;UX, etc.</p>
  
  <h3>Quotes</h3>
  <p>In <span class="bold-text">blog articles and ebooks</span>, <span class="bold-text">separate customer quotes from the body paragraphs</span>. In PRs and other texts, keep the quotes within the paragraphs.</p>
  <p>You may edit quotes, but do not change the message. Generally, quotes are more impactful if they are shorter and direct, so cut out what doesn’t deliver value. You can also alter or add words, but minimally, only to polish the message.</span></p>
  <p>–</span></p>
  
  <h3 class="c17 c15 c37 c31">Bolding, italicizing, and underlining</h3>
  <p>Special emphasis on words/phrases will help your audience easily scan your content. Use bold and <span class="italic-text">italics</span>, but do it sparingly: if everything is emphasized, then nothing truly is. Here are some basic guidelines:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="italic-text">Italics</span>&nbsp;are for quotes, dialogs, or work titles.</li>
    <li><span class="bold-text">Bold</span>&nbsp;is for emphasis on keywords or important phrases.</li>
    <li>Refrain from using both bold and italics.</li>
    <li>Avoid <span class="underline-text">underlining.</span></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Specific terminology</h3>
  
  <h4>App x Application</h4>
  <p><span class="bold-text">Applications</span>&nbsp;are software programs that perform various functions developed for end-users to accomplish specific computing tasks.</p>
  <p><span class="bold-text">Apps</span> are a type of application software that performs a single function, usually on mobile devices.</p>

  <h4>Application x Registration</h4>
  <p>The word "<span class="bold-text">application</span>" refers to a process that may also involve interviews and tests. There's a chance of rejection.</p>
  <p>The word "<span class="bold-text">registration</span>" refers to a process in which you fill in a form, send your documents, maybe pay a fee, and then get the confirmation of your enrollment. There's no chance of rejection.</p>
  
  <h4>Click vs. Click on vs. Click at</h4>
  <p>Click is about pressing a mouse button to select a link or item on the screen. Use "click" as a <span class="bold-text">transitive verb</span>&nbsp;that acts as an action verb and has a direct object—this means that no preposition is required after the verb.</p>
  <p class="c17 c15">🚫 <span class="italic-text">In the Parameter Details column, click on the Edit button.</p>
  <p>✅ <span class="italic-text">To save changes made to the parameter settings, click Save.</span></p>
  
  <h4>Collaborative commerce</h4>
  <p>Do <span class="bold-text">not</span> use the expression "collaborative commerce" in any of your texts.</p>

  <h4>Commerce expert x Commerce specialist</h4>
  <p>Avoid using the expression "commerce expert". Instead, use "<span class="bold-text">commerce specialist</span>."</p>
  
  <h4>Data</h4>
  <p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2">Treat “data” as a</span><span class="bold-text c2">&nbsp;singular noun</span><span class="c2">.</span></p>
  
  <h4>Especially x Specially</h4>
  <p>Use "<span class="bold-text">especially</span>" in the sense of "<span class="bold-text">mainly</span><span class="c1">."</span></p>
  <p class="c12"><span>Use "</span><span class="bold-text">specially</span><span>" in the sense of "</span><span class="bold-text">for a particular purpose</span><span>.</span><span class="c1">"</span></p>
  
  <h4>Future-proof</h4>
  <p class="c42 c15"><span>Do</span> <span class="bold-text">not</span><span>&nbsp;use the expression "future-proof" in any of your texts.</span></p>
  
  <h4>SKU</h4>
  <p class="c17 c15"><span class="c3 c2">SKU can be pronounced as individual letters or as a syllable. This changes the form of the indefinite preposition that should precede it.</span></p>
  <p class="c17 c15"><span class="c3 c2">An “S”-“K”-“U” / A “SKU”</span></p>
  <p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2">We assume the “SKU” pronunciation and use the article “</span><span class="bold-text c2">a</span><span class="c3 c2">.”</span></p>

  <h4>Log in to vs. Log into</h4>
  <p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2">Log in is a phrasal verb that means that you connect to a machine (such as a host, server, workstation, and so on) or authenticate to a user interface by providing your credentials. In this case, "</span><span class="bold-text c2">to</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;"is a preposition that links the phrasal verb to the upcoming word.</span></p>
  <p class="c17 c15"><span class="c3 c2">That is why the correct spelling is log in to not log into.</span></p>
